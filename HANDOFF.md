# HANDOFF.md

Status: **COMPLETE** - All requested tasks finished.

## What Was Done

### 1. Created CLAUDE.md Documentation
- Created root `CLAUDE.md` with monorepo overview
- Created `autograder-back/CLAUDE.md` with backend-specific commands, architecture, API docs, sandbox details
- Created `autograder-web/CLAUDE.md` with frontend commands and structure

### 2. Consolidated Git Repositories
- Removed separate `.git` directories from `autograder-back/` and `autograder-web/`
- Initialized single git repo at root `/Users/cgomes/Dev/autograder/`
- Combined both `.gitignore` files into one at root
- Created initial commit with all 34 files

### 3. Commits Made
```
5ab52fc Split CLAUDE.md into component-specific files
54334c3 Initial monorepo setup
```

## What Worked
- Everything requested was completed successfully
- Both repos had only 1 commit each, so no history was lost in consolidation

## Remaining Work
None - the `/init` task is complete. Delete this file when you've reviewed it.
