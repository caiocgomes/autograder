# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Autograder is a monorepo with two components:
- **autograder-back/**: Python FastAPI backend for automated code grading
- **autograder-web/**: React + TypeScript + Vite frontend

Each component has its own CLAUDE.md with specific commands and architecture details.
